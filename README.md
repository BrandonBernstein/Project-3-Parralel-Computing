# Project 3: Parallel Matrix Multiplication
Due Date: November 10, 2024

Overview
This project focuses on implementing and analyzing two parallel algorithms for multiplying large square matrices on a parallel computer. The algorithms chosen are the Cannon‚Äôs Algorithm and the Fox Algorithm. Each algorithm is tested with matrices of various sizes and on systems with different numbers of CPU cores to assess performance and scalability.

Algorithms
Cannon‚Äôs Algorithm: This method is designed for distributed matrix multiplication, specifically suited for a mesh topology. Cannon‚Äôs Algorithm is efficient for minimizing inter-process communication, making it ideal for systems with high communication overheads.

Fox Algorithm: An alternative approach for matrix multiplication on a mesh grid of processors. The Fox Algorithm is particularly suited for matrices distributed across a square grid and leverages a broadcast mechanism to optimize computation steps in parallel environments.
